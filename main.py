# Code for Texecom Veritas Alarm communicator inteface
# using esp8266 - Nodemcu Development Kit to send alarm
# communications to IFTTT to trigger external responses


# Output from communicator ports is 12V+ and a voltage
# divider is required to reduce to 3.3V.
# use 10k(R1) and 3.3k(R2) to step down 12-13v > 3.3V

# Communicator Interface Channels
# Channel 3 = Intruder
# Channel 4 = Set/Unset
# Channel 8 = 2nd Intruder (Sequentally confirmed alarm)
# R/R can be used for remote reset but not currently implemented
# Pins are high by default and therefore a value of 0 indicates
# an alarm state

# Personal variables
